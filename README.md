# Biathlon Split Time Scraper

This project is a custom web scraper I developed during my **first internship at the CNSNMM** (Centre National de Ski Nordique et de Moyenne Montagne), as part of my **gap year**.

## Purpose

The goal of this scraper is to **extract split time and race data from international biathlon competitions**, including:

- **IBU World Cup**
- **IBU Cup**

At the time, **no official API was available** to access this data in a structured format, so the decision to build a web scraper was made.
